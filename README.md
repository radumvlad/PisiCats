PisiCats
========
A funny game that involves getting to the finish as fast as possible with a random generated path every game. You can play both single player or multiplayer(on the same keyboard) and it produces a lot of fun. The computer uses the short path algorithm to reach the finish, but it's speed is limited and can be changed in settings.
It was my first pure javascript application and one of its goals was to use as much javascript existing functions and objects as it was possible. Also it includes some algorithms for matrix, one of them being the flood fill algorithm.
